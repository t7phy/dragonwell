C                      (nadolsky@pa.msu.edu)
C
C  The input grid files are generated using a code called Legacy, which
C  was written by C. Balazs, G. Ladinsky, P. Nadolsky and C.-P. Yuan. 
C  Legacy also uses various libraries of the CTEQ Collaboration, and it is 
C  developed and maintained by P. Nadolsky (nadolsky@pa.msu.edu). 
C  For more information check http://hep.pa.msu.edu/wwwlegacy/.
C
C  The event generator was created by modifying the popular Monte Carlo 
C  program Papageno (version 3.07) written by Ian Hinchliffe.

C Description
C -----------
C     This program computes the fully differential cross section
C     for processes 
C                          h1 h2 -> B(-> l1 l2) X
C     Here
C          h1 and h2 are hadrons (pion, proton, pBar or a nucleon),
C          B is a single vector boson (a virtual photon, W+-, Z0 or Higgs),
C            or a pair of vector bosons (presently photon- or Z-pair).
C          l1 and l2 are decay products (when applicable).
C
C     The cross section is calculated in either LO (mostly O(alpha_s^0)) or with
C     NLO QCD corrections or with resummed QCD corrections included,
C     depending on the type of the input grid.
C     The code implements the CSS resummation formalism extended to the
C     decay lepton level (PLB355 (1995) 548 and hep-ph/9704258).
C     It contains the exact matrix elements for the B production 
C     (including initial state soft gluon resummation effects) 
C     and for the decay. It contains the B width (when applicable) and full 
C     spin-correlation effects.
C
C     The structure of the Monte Carlo event
C     generator is the same as popular MC program PAPAGENO, written by
C     Ian Hinchliffe. The program uses VEGAS as integration routine
C     to evaluate the phase space integrals. It produces the relevant
C     distributions in forms of histograms.
C
C     The code is written such that the file resbosm.f contain the modules for
C     the MC calculation and the file resbos.f is a front end to resbosm.f.
C     The code is ready for use as it is, in principle only the input file
C     should be changed.
C
C     In case of an effort to customize ResBos it is desirable to change only
C     the routines in resbos.f.

C ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C    Description and typical values for input parameters
C
C    iGen
C    Number of loops over the whole code. Use just 1 since as of 7/1/97 the
C    total cross section is not corrected by this value.
C
C    ITMX1
C    Number of preliminary MC iterations (E.g.: 5-10)
C
C    NCALL1
C    Number of MC events in preliminary iterations (E.g.: 5000-10000)
C    In the firts round (ITMX1,NCALL1) Vegas just samples the cross section
C    but does not contribute to the final MC events.
C    NCALL1/ITMX1 should be kept around 1000.
C
C    ITMX2
C    Number of main MC iterations (E.g.: 10-100)
C
C    NCALL2
C    Number of MC events in main iterations (E.g.: 10000-50000)
C    The trick is to keep the NCALL/ITMX ratio around 1000 and preferably
C    run with low NCALL2 (~10-20k) and many iterations iTMX2 (20-100), 
C    depending on how much MC events (how much precision) is desired.
C
C    ISEED  an integer seed for the random number generator
 
C    GRID_FILEx
C    To run this program, the appropriate input data grid files are needed,
C    which is the output of the vector boson production code Legacy. The
C    grids contain the resummed or the Y-piece portions of
C       d(sigma)/d(Q_T)/dy/dQ^2
C    for _polarized_ V boson.
C    The Y-piece grid is not neccesary, the code can be run with only the
C    resummed grid. In that case in the place of the Y-piece grid name the
C    user has to write "-" (a negative sign without quotes), indicating that
C    only the resummed result is desired.
C    The presently available grids are listed below.
C
C    IWGT
C    0 (default): return weighted (conventional) cross sections 
C    1: returns unweighted events
C   -1: return weighted events and save weights for the matrix element
c       and phase space in an external file weights.dat
C   -2: read the weight for the matrix element from weights.dat and
c       substitute for the current ME weight in the Monte-Carlo
c       integration. IWGT=-1 and -2 are useful for generation of events 
c       N error PDF sets using kinematically the same events for all 
c       PDF sets. See REWEIGHTING below
C
C
C    iKFacP, iKFacY
cpn2008 NOTE: this feature is not needed with some latest grids which already
C     include O(alpha_s^2) contributions from the beginning; 
c     just keep iKFacP=iKFacY=0 with such grids
C    Original description (circa 1997): The Y piece grids contain 
C    the O(alpha_s) Y regular and Perturbative pieces.
C    If the user wants to use O(alpha_s^2) Y and Pert pieces then iKFacP and
C    iKFacY should be set to 1. This feature is implemented for W and Z
C    production as of 7/1/97. (Typical: 1, 1)
C
C    iYGrid
CCPY iYGrid=1 for reading in Y-grid files with old format
CCPY iYGrid=2 for reading in Y-grid files with new format
C iYGrid=1
C    ' Q,qT,y, Singular (K*L0,K*A3), Pert. (KP*L0,KP*A3,A1,A2,A4)'
C iYGrid=2
C    ' Q,qT,y, Singular (L0,A3), Pert. (L0,A3), R_A1, R_A2, R_A4, R_A0'  
C (Typical: 2)
C
CCPY
c    iMG (iMatchOut)
c    deterimines if the matched resummed+Y grid is saved in a file (1)
c    or not (0, default).
c
C    iMM (iMatchMethod)
c    determines the procedure for the matching of the resummed 
c    and Y grids (default: 0)
c
C    PTl1CUT
C    Cut on the pT of the first final state particle
C    ( anti-lepton for W/Z/photon production ).
C    E.g.: for W+ the positron pT > PTl1CUT.
C
C    Yl1CUT
C    Cut on the rapidity of the first final state particle.
C    E.g.: for W+ the positron |y| < Yl1CUT.
C
C    PTNCUT
C    Cut on P_T of the second final state particle
C    ( lepton for W/Z/photon production ).
C    E.g.: for W+ the missing E_T (P_T of neutrino) < PTl2CUT.
C
C    DELR_CUT
C    Delta R between the two final state particles.
C    Used for double boson production only (typically: 0.4).
C    For sinle V production should be set it to zero.
C
C    YM12MIN, YM12MAX
C    Minimum and maximum invariant mass of V (limited by the input grid).
C    (For W production typically: 50, 110 [GeV]).

C    YM12MIN, YM12MAX
C    Minimum and maximum invariant mass of V (limited by the input grid).
C    (For W production typically: 40, 500 [GeV]).
C
C    QT_Min, QT_Max
C    Minimun and maximum transverse momentum of V (limited by the input grid).
C    (For W production typically: 0, 300 [GeV]).
C
C    yWmin, yWMax
C    Minimun and maximum rapidity of V in the laboratory frame
C    
C    MTmin, MTMax, ETmin: minimal and maximal transverse mass of the
c    lepton pair, minimum missing transverse energy associated with the neutrino
c    in the case of W boson production
C
C    YLUMI
C    Luminosity of the collider. E.g.: 1000 [pb^(-1)].
C    If set to 1 the code returns cross sections in pb.
C    
C    mt, mH: top quark and Higgs boson masses
C
C    Output
C    Possible choices:
C    GBook  -> Produces built in coarse histograms
C              Results in resbos.out (ASCII) can be viewed
C              without any further software.
C    HBook  -> Produces built in histograms in RESBOS.HB (binary).
C              User needs PAW to view these histograms.
C    NT -> Produces NTuple with built in variables.
C              User needs PAW to view RESBOS.NT (binary).
C    Custom -> Produces NTuple with custom variables and cuts.
C              For more on this option see the
C              usr_resbos_... routines in this file.
C              ( The user is recommended to change only these
C                routines to preserve the consistency of the
C                physics in this ResBos. )
C    qTSep
C    Used only by the NLO option. Gives the scale where the
C    LO and NLO phase spaces are separated in QT.
C
C    PDF,Proc,Sc,ACut
C    These parameters are active only for calculating perturbative contributions
C    for diphoton production.  Except ACut which is also active for the W piece.
C
C    BIPDF 
C    Selects the PDF for the O(alpha_s) h1 h2 -> photon photon process.
C    ResBos has the built in amplitude squared for the Perturbative
C    calculation, in contrast to the CSS and Asymptotic cases where
C    it uses the grids. These grids were generated for a particular
C    parton distribution, and the PDF input (which is only active
C    for the Perturbative calculation) has to match the PDF for which
C    the grid was generated. (For the specific PDF choices look into
C    FUNCTION ALPHAS).
C
C    Proc
C    Selects the partonic initial state for the above process
C    = 1 generate q qBar -> A A X only,
C    = 2 generate q g -> A A X only,   
C    = 0 generate all the above.
C    Only active for the Perturbative process.
C 
C    Sc
C    ITScale is the scale at which the above matrix-elements and PDF is
C    evaluated.
C    = 1 -> mu = wHat
C    Specific renormalization and factorization scale choices
C    for diphoton production:
C    = 5 -> mu = invariant mass of the photon pair,
C    = 6 -> mu = half invariant mass of the photon pair,
C    = 7 -> mu = (pT(photon_1)+pT(photon_2))/2.
C
C    Acut   
C    A theory cut that prevents the above matrix element from blowing up.
C    Look into SUBROUTINE PRIMARY_CUTS if you want to see what it
C    does. Just use it as I did in my samples above. It should not
C    effect the physical results.
C
C    iSub   
C    Controls the calculation of the fragmentation piece.
C    = 0 no subtraction is done
C    = 1 a collinear piece is subtracted from the qG->AAq amplitude
C        unconditionally
C    = 2 a collinear piece is subtracted from the qG->AAq amplitude
C        if the invariant mass of the collinear pair < 5 GeV
C    = 3 a collinear piece is subtracted from the qG->AAq amplitude
C        and a fragmentation piece is added 
C    = 4 a collinear piece is subtracted from the qG->AAq amplitude
C            if the invariant mass of the collinear pair < cutM45 GeV
C            and a fragmenation piece is added
C    =-1 experimental isolation at Q_T > E_T^{iso}
C    =-2 quasi-experimental isolation at Q_T > E_T^{iso} combined
C             with smooth-cone isolation at Q_T < E_T^{iso}
C     isub=12 quasi-experimental isolation at Q_T > E_T^{iso} combined
C             with smoothly turned-on subtraction at Q_T < E_T^{iso}
C     isub=13 quasi-experimental isolation for Q_T > E_T_gamma*E_T^{iso}
c             (where E_T^{iso} denotes a dimensionless ratio of hadronic and
c              photonic energy in the isolation cone),
c             combined with smoothly turned on subtracton at
c             Q_T < E_T_gamma*E_T^{iso}      
cpn2006 isub=3,4 temporarily disabled as of August 2006
C isub=-1 or -2: defined in function ConeETmax
C     iSub note: iSub=2, 12, 13 achieve Y = P - A ~ 0 at QT ~ 0 both at the 
C            Tevatron and the LHC.
C
CsB___iHQApprox = 1 and 2 for finite m_t and infinite m_t respectively

C Important Remarks about the Y piece and the O(alpha_s) options
C
C     The resummed grids contain only the resummed part of the resummation
C     formula (see PLB355 (1995) 549). When comparing with experiment
C     one has to include the Y piece. The O(alpha_s) calculation is impelented
C     such that the "NLO" grids contain only the finite parts of the Q_T
C     singular pieces. Again, when comparing with experiment one has to
C     include the Y piece.
C
C     The O(alpha_s) calculation is somewhat tricky. One has to run ResBos
C     twice and add the resulted histograms by hand. This is because the
C     phase space is split into 2 parts
C       2 -> 2 with V having Q_T<Q_T^Separation and
C       2 -> 3 with V having Q_T>Q_T^Separation.
C     It is done to regulate the singularity at Q_T^W = 0.
C
C     Operationally, the user runs the asymptotic piece first with the Y-piece
C     (the sample below is for p pBar -> Z(-> e+ e-) X @ Tevatron, no cuts):
C
C 1, 5,1000, 5, 20000                               > Vegas parameters
C Z0_ASY_CTEQ4M.DAT                                 > Low QT Grid
C Z0_Y_CTEQ4M.DAT                                   > Y piece
C 0                                                 > 0=Weighted 1=Unveighted
C  0.00,99.0,0.0, 0.00,99.0                         > Cuts: pT1,y1,R,pT2,y2
C 60., 110.0, 30.0                                  > Cuts: QMn, QMx, QTMax
C 1.0d3                                             > Luminosity (pb^-1)
C HBook                                             > Output
C 1.2, 50.0                                         > qT_Sep for NLO, QT match
C
C     Then the user runs the "DSI" piece without the Y-piece:
C
C 1, 5,1000, 5, 20000                               > Vegas parameters
C Z0_DSI_CTEQ4M.DAT                                 > Low QT Grid

C 0                                                 > 0=Weighted 1=Unveighted
C  0.00,99.0,0.0, 0.00,99.0                         > Cuts: pT1,y1,R,pT2,y2
C 60., 120.0, 30.0                                  > Cuts: QMn, QMx, QTMax
C 1.0d3                                             > Luminosity (pb^-1)
C HBook                                             > Output
C 1.2, 50.0                                         > qT_Sep for NLO, QT match
C
C     Then the HBooks has to be added together histogram by histogram.
C
C
C Outputs
C
C    If the output switches HBook or NTuple are used
C    a file called resbos.hb or resbos.nt is created which are binary files.
C    resbos.hb contains numerous HBooks. The format of HBooks is compatible
C    with PAW. Another file, resbos.out, summarizes the inputs and the total
C    rate for the given run.

C Compilation
C -----------
C    This program was developed and tested on VAX, Alpha, Sun, NeXT and PC
C    machines using various FORTRAN compilers.
C    The source code is self-contained, for the purpose of the
C    calculation it is not required to link with any libraries.
C    However, the user has to link this code with the CERN libraries
C       PACKLIB and KERNLIB
C    to generate the HBook or NTuple Output.
C    An example of a linux makefile is included below:
C    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
C    # ResBos makefile for CygWin with g77 - C. Balazs, Apr. 21, 2001
C    
C    FC = g77
C    
C    FCFlags = -c -O2 -fno-automatic -fvxt 
C    LCFlags = '-oresbos.x'
C    
C    Libs = -L/cygdrive/d/Csabi/Codes/CERNLib/2003/lib -lpacklib

C
C Reweighting
C -----------
C It is often necessary to compute resummed cross sections for
c the same kinematics of particles in each Monte-Carlo event and a 
c large number N of special PDF sets in order to estimate the
c PDF uncertainty in the cross section.  Since the kinematical 
c variables are kept the same in each event for all the PDF sets, 
c the random Monte-Carlo fluctuations cancel in the computation of the PDF
c uncertainty, and accurate results for the PDF errors can be
c obtained with a smaller number of events. The same procedure can
c be applied to reduce the effect of Monte-Carlo fluctuations on
c various cross section ratios, provided the kinematical shape of all
c cross sections in such ratios is roughly the same.
c
c In this calculation, one needs to obtain a set of N cross section
c weights for each Monte-Carlo event. The reweighting is carried out 
c in two steps. In the first step, run ResBos to compute cross sections 
c for a reference (e.g., best-fit) PDF set using iwgt=-1 option (save event
c information in an auxiliary file weights.dat). Rename the
c produced HBOOK or NTUPLE (e.g., move resbos.hbook to resbos_1.hbook). 
c
c In the second step, set iwgt=-2 (read event information 
c from weights.dat) and  run ResBos N-1 times for each of 
c the remaining PDF sets, renaming resulting resbos.hbook
c files each time (e.g., resbos.2.hbook, resbos.3.hbook, ..., 
c resbos.N.hbook). Upon the completion of the calculation, events 
c in all .hbook files will have exactly the same kinematics, 
c but the matrix element weights will be different due to the 
c variations in the PDF sets.
c
c If the output format is an ntuple, all ntuples in the second
c step contain only the cross section weights, while the
c kinematical variables are the same as in the first step. This is
c done to save disk space while generating ntuples for many PDF sets.

C Program History
C ---------------
C      4/1994 Created by C. Balazs and C.-P. Yuan.
C     12/1994 The code was cleaned up from unnecersary routines,
C             consistency of variables, common blocks and modules
C             has been checked.
C      1/1995 Interpolation routine has been replaced by 3DInterp.
C             Now the code can take any (for upper bound see
C             declarations of arrays) size input data grid.
C             A primitive documentation on the structure of the code
C             is now available.
C      2/1995 Photon-lepton and Z-lepton coupling has been set.
C             The output of the histograms has been 'modulized',
C             so that custom output device(s) can be implemented easily
C             and without disturbing the physics content of the code.
C             Now the code runs on both NeXT and VAX platforms.
C      3/1995 Both HBook and NTuple type of output works.
C      4/1995 GBook was installed.
C      8/1995 Custom output routine is attached.
C             Photon-lepton and Z-lepton coupling has been rewised.
C      9/1995 Couplings and constants set to be compatible with Legacy.
C     10/1995 It's checked to correctly generate the kinematics of the
C             decay products of W+, W-, Z0 and A0.
C             Legacy and ResBos out/input files are compatible.
C     12/1995 NLO process works.
C      3/1996 Double photon production implemented.
C      4/1996 Renormalization scale dependence for the gluon-gluon
C             initiated processes installed.
C      6/1996 pp initial state option is added.
C      7/1996 Interpolation at the boundary of y phase space is improved.
C      9/1996 Grids with just one Q value are accepted.
C             In its effect it is equivalent with the narrow
C             width approximation for W and Z.
C             Analytic approximation for the low qT behavior of the
C             Asymptotic piece is implemented.
C             Coupled with this the interpolation of the CSS, ASY and Y
C             pieces was changed. For these the order of interpolation is:
C             y first, then Q, finally qT. A small bug in the Y piece
C             interpolation was fixed.
C     10/1996 ReadIn routine fixed: negative values for the grid are allowed.
C             Negative weights are allowed. Negative histograms can be
C             generated for the delta-sigma piece.
C             Breit-Wigner shape (W/Z line-shapes) was changed according
C             the LEP convention.
C     11/1996 The setup of interpolation of the Delta Sigma piece (nPart = 13)
C             was changed from N_QT_INTP=1 to N_QT_INTP=4. In other words
C             now we do interpolate in the pT direction for Delta Sigma.
C      1/1997 Matching is done using the grid. In particular: for W+/- and Z0
C             Q = M_V and y = 0 are fixed. Then the approximate crossing point
C             of the CSS + Y and the K-factor * Perturbative qT distributions
C             is determined. This point is used as matching point. With a very
C             good approximation this is the same as the crossing points of
C             the Q and y integrated cross sections.
C             For photon, higgs, gluon and double gauge bosons the matching
C             point is still has to be given in the input file.
C      2/1997 Introduced iGen. The generator routine is in a loop now, so
C             that several run can be done and written into the same HBook.
C             This way the distributions are smoother since the random number
C             generation starts from a different value every time.
C             Cut on minimum of QT (of produced [lepton/photon] pair)
C             from input file.
C             The W,Z and top masses are read from the grid.
C      3/1997 Crossing points of CSS and Asymptotic pieces are determined.
C             For W/Z this is done for Q = MV and y = 0. For A0, AA and AG is
C             done for the highest Q in the grid and y = 0.
C      4/1997 D0 cuts (for W mass measurement) are included as an option.
C      5/1997 Renormalization and factorization scale dependences for the
C             built in NLO AA process (for both q qB and q G initial states)
C             are corrected. Scale choices implemented:
C             - invariant mass of the photon pair (ITSCALE = 5),
C             - half invariant mass of the photon pair (ITSCALE = 6),
C             - (pT(photon_1)+pT(photon_2))/2 (ITSCALE = 7).
C      6/1997 Q, QT and Y dependent O(alpha_s^2) K-factors for the
C             Perturbative and Y L0 (alias 'symmetric') pieces are implemented.
C             To include these K-factors two K-factor grid files are required
C             which are the output of Arnold's O(alpha_s^2) perturbative and
C             resummed code.
C             Matching is done event by event. First MatPt is determined.
C             MatPt is the lowest second crossing point of the Total and Pert
C             cross sections in the whole Q and y range. When the weight
C             is calculate for QT > MatPt the Total QT cross section is
C             tested vs. the Pert and the higher one is used in the weight.
C      7/1997 Matching is rewised. It is done at the grid level. After the CSS
C             and Y grids are read in a unified (matched grid) is created
C             in the following fashion. The Q and y coordinates
C             of the Y grid are taken as the coordinates of the matched grid and
C             the CSS piece is interpolated at those Q and y points. Once the
C             CSS + Y and Pert pieces are known for these Q and y values the
C             crossing points of the triple differential cross sections (CSS+Y
C             and Pert) are determined for each Q and y. In the knowledge of the
C             second crossing pionts between the CSS + Y and the Pert curves
C             for qT values lower than the crossing point the CSS + Y grid is
C             loaded into the L0 and A3 values of the Y grid. For qT's larger
C             than the second crossing point the Pert piece is copied there,
C             for each Q and y.
C             When determining on the weight of an event, only this matched
C             gris is interpolated.
C      9/1997 A collinear subtraction term for the q G -> A A q process is
C             included which subtracts the collinear singularity when one of
C             the photons and the final state fermion are collinear. The
C             calculation of the subtraction term is done along the line of
C             Catani-Seymour hep-ph/9607318.
C             HBooks are reorganized.
C     10/1997 Fragmentation is included for the q G -> A A q type process.
C     11/1997 Running of the EW coupling is implemented.
C     12/1997 Fixed target q Q -> A A, q G -> A A implemented.
C      1/1998 q Q, q G, Q G -> Z Z resummed, asymptotic and fixed order
C             perturbative (real emissions) process is installed and tested
C             against the NLO results.
C      2/1998 G G -> H0 G -> Z Z G process is installed.
C             The LO process was tested
C             against Papageno and results in the literature (Dicus &
C             Glover-Bi). The CSS and Perturbative
C             processes are also working. The G G -> H0 G -> Z Z G process
C             checks out against Baur-Glover.
C      4/1998 W+/- h production is installed.
C      5/1998 Kappa coefficient for G G -> H0 is added.
C      5/1999 Formal modifications are done to make ResBos compile and run
C             on Linux platforms.
C      2/2000 New type matching implemented based on the 2001 les Houches 
C             proceedings (cf. Balazs, Collins, Soper).
C      3/2000 Z-decays included for h1 h2 -> H X -> Z Z X -> l L l' L' X
C      1/2004 New Legacy grid is recognized and can be read. This allows 
C             the use of kinematics independent B^(2) coefficients for 
C             for both of the qQ and gg initiated resummed diphoton processes. 
C             The kinematics independent C^(1) coefficient for the gg->AA process
C             is also implemented. The CFG resummation scheme is installed for
C             the diphoton processes. 
C             The 3D interpolation was also somewhat improved.
C      4/2004 C(1) and B(2) coefficients for g g -> A A X are implemented.
C             B(2) coefficient for q Q -> A A X is implemented.
C      5/2004 Most of ResBosA code and modifications are fused into ResBos.
C             Especially, subroutine Standard was updated.
C      9/2004 Z mass and width are made optional inputs.
